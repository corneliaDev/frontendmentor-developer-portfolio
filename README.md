# Frontend Mentor - Single-page developer portfolio

This is a solution based on Frontend Mentor [Single-page developer portfolio coding challenge] [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

on my site based on the Frontend Mentor Challenge

## Layout

The designs were created to the following widths:

- Mobile: 375px
- Tablet: 768px
- Desktop: 1440px

  Mobil-first

## The challenge

You should be able to:

- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Email or Name field is empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
  - db error
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Hook the form up so it sends and stores the user's enquiry (you can use a spreadsheet or Airtable to save the enquiries)
- **Bonus**: Add your own details (image, skills, projects) to replace the ones in the design
